Package for more specific MitPhysics tools
==========================================

 - general bambu tools are available in MitAna
 - these are really for more specific analyses like
   - electron, muon ID, special jet corrections etc.

 - this package also relies on some data that are not stored in GITHUB
   as they are too large
 - please bootstrap this package, therefore do:

   git clone -b $MIT_TAG https://github.com/cpausmit/MitPhysics.git
   ./MitPhysics/bin/updateData.sh

 - data will be pulled in and are automatically unpacked in the expected
   directory: MitPhysics/data
