Package for more specific MitPhysics tools
==========================================

 - general bambu tools are available in MitAna
 - these are really for more specific analyses like
   - electron, muon ID, special jet corrections etc.

 - this package also relies on some data that are not stored in GITHUB
   as they are too large and on some packages as fastjet and its
   contributions. The environment variable MIT_DATA should point
   to the directory where such static big data are located. By default
   it should point to /cvmfs/cvmfs.cmsaf.mit.edu/hidsk0001/cmsprod/cms/MitPhysics/data.

Documentation for specific modules
==================================

[JetIdMod]
Input file names for PU jet Id parameters (MVA weights and cuts) must be provided.
The default configuration is as follows:
MVA weights:
 - Pre-run2 AK4PF -> MIT_DATA/TMVAClassificationCategory_JetID_MET_53X_Dec2012.weights.xml
 - Pre-run2 AK4PFCHS -> MIT_DATA/TMVAClassification_5x_BDT_chsFullPlusRMS.weights.xml
Cuts: MIT_DATA/jetIDCuts_121221.dat
