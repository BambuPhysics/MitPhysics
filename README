Package for more specific MitPhysics tools
==========================================

 - general bambu tools are available in MitAna
 - these are really for more specific analyses like
   - electron, muon ID, special jet corrections etc.

 - this package also relies on some data that are not stored in GITHUB
   as they are too large and on some packages as fastjet and its
   contributions
 - please bootstrap this package, therefore do:

   git clone -b $MIT_TAG https://github.com/cpausmit/MitPhysics.git
   ./MitPhysics/bin/setup.sh

 - data will be pulled in and are automatically unpacked in the expected
   directory: MitPhysics/data
 - $CMSSW_BASE/config/toolbox/... will be updated
